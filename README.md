ðŸ§® A basic calculator built using C# Console App.  
This was created as part of my learning journey through C# fundamentals.

- User Input Handling
- Arithmetic & Logical Operators
- Control Flow (`if`/`else`)
- Boolean Logic
- Methods (Void & Return Types)
- Basic Error Handling with `int.Parse`

## ðŸ”§ Future Plans
- Add division operation
- Handle invalid input safely using `int.TryParse`
- Refactor into reusable methods
- Enhance to include a loop and support more operations
